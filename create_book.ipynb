    "This might a relic of the past, but in the past there were (mostly fantasy) book that were telling a story while also being interactive and letting you choose your own adventure. It was like a DnD, but for only one player.\n",
    "\n",
    "They worked the following way:\n",
    "You were reading the book like you would normally, but every couple of sentences or paragraphs, you'd have to make a choice how to continue. The choice involved two things. Each choice would lead you to a different page or paragraph of the book. Something like \"If you want to go through the door, go to 43. If you want to try your luck with the staircase, go to 182\". Additionally, there could be an element of luck. There, you'd roll dice and see if you manage to avoid some obstacle. Many books also include a simple class and/or abilities system, where you choose what kind of character you want to be. You might choose to be a warrior or a sorcerer. Or you might put most of the skill point to intelligence and agility, as opposed to strength. These traits would influence the results of your dice rolls. "
